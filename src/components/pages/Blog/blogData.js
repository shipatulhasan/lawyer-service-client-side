        question:`Difference between SQL and NoSQL ?`,
        ans:`
        Type: SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. Language: SQL databases defines and manipulates data based structured query language (SQL) on the otherhand NOSQL database have dynamic schema for unstructured data. That means can be stored both document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store. Scalability: SQL are vericaly scalable and NOSQL are horizontally scalable. Ex: Squl: MySQL, PostgreSQL NOSQL: MongoDB, GraphQL`

        question:`How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time ?`,
        ans:`
        NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. It is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. It has it's own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener for the EventQueue. 

        If NodeJS can process the request without I/O blocking then the event loop would itself process the request and sends the response back to the client by itself. But, it is possible to process multiple requests parallelly using the NodeJS cluster module or worker_threads modul
